# The inFiltrator

## To configure
In whichever filter you wish to run, open that python file and update the arrays to include the numbers you want to filter on.

## To run
Install python3

place a file in this directory called "input.txt". This will be the input that is filtered.

Commands:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 filter_<dask or pandas>.py`

The result will be a file called "output.txt" containing the filtered result.
